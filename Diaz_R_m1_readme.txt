I completed all of the requirements as I know them for the assignment. I have:
- A terrain with a ramp and bridge leading to two elevated areas
- A model created with Fuse that will fit my team's project theme
- An animation controller for the model that
	- has Speed, Direction, Jump, and Punch parameters for animations
	- uses Idle, TurnLeft, TurnRight Locomotion, WalkBack, Jump, and Punch states
	- uses Blend Trees to blend different turning animations and walking to running
- I created a script to control the animation parameters to move, jump, and punch

Acquired Assets:
- I used free animations from Mixamo's site
- I used animations provided in Unity's Mecanim tutorial for walking and running
- I acquired a punch animation from the Unity Asset Store 
(found here: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/36286)

Install:
- There are no special install instructions

Game:
- Move the player with W,A,S,D or a gamepad
- Moving forward, the player will blend from walking to running animation
- Moving (forwards or backwards) while turning will blend from walking/running straight to a full turn
- Standing still and turning (A or D on keyboard) will turn the character in place
- Pressing the spacebar will make the character jump in place
- Pressing the F key will make the character throw a punch
- Holding the Left Shift will limit the speed animation parameter 
and cause the character to walk (Since I use a keyboard)

Use Scene1 as the main file
